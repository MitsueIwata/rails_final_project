# Bulletin: A calendar of community events

The site will allow people to create communities and to post events to a community calendar to share with the general public. The idea is similar to meetup.com, but focuses around a calendar of events.

Once users create an account, they can create and post events, such as guest speakers, volunteering opportunities, food drives, etc., on calendars. Create or join a community, or comment on other community member's events.

Events will be created by users and posted to calendars. Anyone can view the calendars, but only people in the community can post to the calendar and comment on the event. Events also have categories, such as workshop, mentoring, entrepreneurship, etc.

Communities can be defined geographically, or by interest, or both. For example, Woodlawn Youth, or DIY.

Calendars will be populated with events for each community.
